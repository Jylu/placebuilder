* Medium tasks

** Merge the controllers in the management namespace with the un-namespaced controllers. There isn't significant overlap as far as controller actions go, and having the management namespace isn't as clean as originally thought

** Update to the latest version of sammy. Which has breaking changes to our codebase, but introduces some cool stuff. See http://www.quirkey.com/blog/2010/09/02/sammy-0-6-california-suite/

** Hand-in-hand with updating sammy, get rid of those *.json.erb files, and give up all pretense of supporting non-javascript enabled browsers. (Facebook doesn't!)

* Large tasks

** Rails 3
