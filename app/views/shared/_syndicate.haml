          Hey guys, I'm just trying to put this new satelite dish up on my roof, but I don't have a ladder! Anyone have one I can borrow for the afternoon? (You might end up with some cookies later)

              I have a ladder you can use. But I won't be available until sometime tomorrow afternoon. Is that OK?
