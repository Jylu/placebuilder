Subdomains

  Everything happens on a subdomain; no part of the app runs without either admin.host or #{community.slug}.host.

  A community of name "West Roxbury" and slug "westroxbury" is setup by rake db:setup. To get this working at westroxbury.localhost, you'll have to add westroxbury.localhost to your /etc/hosts. When you're done, /etc/localhosts shoould have a line like:

    127.0.0.1	localhost admin.localhost westroxbury.localhost
